# CustomiseOldcord
A colour customisable version of OldCord with some fixes

Currently the colour setup is similar to just before the update, only slightly desaturated! You can edit the colours easily by opening the file in a TXT doc or putting the code in your QuickCSS - everything is labelled and easy to figure out!
